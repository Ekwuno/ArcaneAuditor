## [Unreleased]

### Added: GitHub Action

- **Composite GitHub Action** (`action.yml`): `uses: Developers-and-Dragons/ArcaneAuditor@<tag>` installs the pinned CLI release (sha256 verified), runs `review-app --agent` over one or more paths, and reports findings as `::error` / `::warning` annotations plus a job summary. Inputs: `path`, `config`, `version`, `output`, `fail-on`, `annotate`, `rules`, `exclude-rules`, `files`. Outputs: `report`, `action-count`, `advice-count`, `error-count`, `exit-code`. Needs only `contents: read`, so it works on fork pull requests.
- **Merged report**: findings from every path are combined into one schema 2.0 report with `location.file_path` prefixed by the audited directory and a `runs` array (`ok` / `skipped` / `missing` / `error`). CLI exit 2 or 3 becomes a synthetic `ArcaneAuditorError` ACTION finding instead of a silent failure.
- **Standalone scripts**: `.github/action/install.sh`, `run.sh`, `merge.mjs`, `annotate.mjs` work outside GitHub for local use.
- **Self-test workflow**: `.github/workflows/action-selftest.yml` runs the action against `tests/fixtures/action/` on Linux and macOS.
- **Docs**: `docs/GITHUB_ACTION.md` and a README section.

## [v2.0.0] - 2026-05-16

**Breaking schema change.** JSON output is now v2: nested `location`, new per-finding fields. v1 consumers must update.

### Added — agent-facing JSON

- `**--agent` CLI flag** — quiet, JSON to stdout, no default output file. Mutually exclusive with `--ci`; rejects non-JSON `--format`.
- **v2 schema** — top-level `schema_version: "2.0"`. Findings carry `category`, `fix_strategy`, `fix_strategy_overridden`, `snippet`, `suggested_replacement`, `target_text`, `replacement_context`, `finding_id`, and a nested `location` (`file_path`, `line`, `column`, `end_line`, `end_column`, `path`).
- `**location.path`** — JSONPath into PMD/POD/AMD/SMD files; stable across line-drifting edits. Endpoint findings use `$.{inbound|outbound}Endpoints[?(@.name=='X')].subkey`, AMD uses `$.dataProviders[?(@.key=='X')].value`, orchestration uses tuple-derived or `$..nodes[?(@.name=='X')]` selectors. `null` for `.script` files and a few file-level findings.
- **Deterministic agent fix payload** — `suggested_replacement` + `target_text` + `replacement_context` together let agents apply fixes as substring swaps rather than full-field overwrites. `replacement_context` is one of `substring`, `full_field`, `array_splice`, `array_remove`, `field_insert`. Wired on all 12 `actionable` rules.
- `**fix_strategy_overridden`** — `true` when the effective strategy came from user config rather than the rule author's default. Agents check this to detect user-promoted `human_review→actionable` findings, which lack a deterministic fix payload.
- `**finding_id**` — stable hash of `rule_id|file_path|path|message` (line excluded) so re-runs after a fix join on the same id.
- `**fix_strategy` and `category` rule metadata** — `actionable` vs `human_review`; `script` / `structure` / `endpoint` / `widget` / `orchestration` / `custom`. User config can override per rule.

### Added — CLI & docs

- `**list-rules --format json`**, `**describe-rule <RuleId>**` — machine-readable rule catalog + per-rule docs (`why`, `catches`, `examples`, `recommendation`).
- **Filter flags on `review-app`** — `--rules`, `--exclude-rules`, `--severity`, `--fix-strategy`, `--files <glob>`. Unknown values exit `2`.
- `**SKILL.md**` + `**agent-help` command** — agent-facing skill doc, installable from frozen binaries via `arcane-auditor agent-help > ~/.claude/skills/arcane-auditor/SKILL.md`.
- **Deterministic finding order** — sorted by `(file_path, line, rule_id, message)`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `file_path` and `line` moved from top-level into nested `location`; top-level gains `schema_version`.
- **Individual-file mode** — `location.file_path` now reflects the path as supplied (matches directory/ZIP mode).
- `**PMDSectionOrderingRule`** — reclassified to `human_review`; whole-document key reorder isn't a single deterministic edit.

### Fixed

- **Silent file loss on duplicate ids** — `context.pmds` / `context.pods` are now keyed by `file_path` instead of `pageId` / `podId`. Unused `get_pmd_by_id` / `get_pod_by_id` accessors removed.
- `**"Pod_seed endpoint"` finding message** — normalized `'pod_seed'` label to `'pod'` in `EndpointNameLowerCamelCaseRule`.

## [v1.6.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added

- **Desktop folder analysis** — In the desktop app, **Browse… → Project folder…** selects a local directory; analysis uses the same recursive directory processing as the CLI, preserving relative paths (including duplicate filenames in different subfolders). Gated API (`POST /api/analyze-directory`) enabled only for the desktop shell.

### Changed

- **Upload UI** — Single **Browse…** menu for ZIP archive, source files, or project folder (folder option on desktop only).

---

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added

- **Linux CLI Build & Release** - Official Linux CLI artifact for CI and headless environments.
  - Single executable built with PyInstaller (onefile); distributed as `ArcaneAuditor_linux_CLI.tar.gz` with SHA-256 checksum.
  - Built on Ubuntu 22.04 in GitHub Actions; included in tagged releases alongside Windows and macOS assets.
- **Docker Definition Files** - Repo includes Dockerfiles for running the CLI in containers (definition files only; no prebuilt images published).
  - `Dockerfile.cli-src` - Run CLI from source with `uv` (development/CI experimentation).

  - See [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for build and run examples.
- `**--ci` CLI Preset** - One flag for CI/CD: quiet output, JSON format, and default output file (`arcane-auditor-results.json`); overridable with `--format` and `--output`.
- **Orchestration Support** - Validation for `.orchestration` and `.suborchestration` files; rule count increased to 48 with orchestration-specific rules (security domains, error handlers, branching, expression best practices).
- **Linux Configuration Paths** - Documented config locations for Linux CLI: `~/.config/ArcaneAuditor/config/rules/teams/` and `~/.config/ArcaneAuditor/config/rules/personal/`.

### Changed

- **README (v1.5)** - Updated for Linux CLI download/usage, Docker subsection, interface table (CLI on Windows, macOS, Linux), and configuration paths; Quick Start highlights v1.5 features.
- **Release Workflow** - Added Linux CLI job; release artifact naming: `ArcaneAuditor_linux_CLI.tar.gz` and `ArcaneAuditor_linux_CLI.tar.gz.sha256`.

### Fixed

- **Modal Ergonomics** - Optimized modal dimensions with shrink-wrap behavior and fixed desktop width for consistent experience across screen sizes.
- **Configuration Cards** - Gone are the huge configuration cards, in favor of a less dominant presence.

### Fixed

## [v1.3.0] - 2025-11-11

### Added

- **Version Awareness Everywhere** - Packaging-driven source of truth now surfaces through the `__version__` module, CLI `--version` flag, desktop splash/title, and the web UI badge.
- **Automated Update Detection** - Full update checker stack with FastAPI endpoints, desktop bridge, and web wiring backed by a preferences manager with opt-in, timestamp, and cache fields.
- **In-App Settings Panel** - Hover-expanding settings orb lets users toggle automated update checks without leaving the primary workflow.

- **Update Caching Strategy** - Server and desktop health checks reuse GitHub responses for five minutes to respect external rate limits.

### Fixed

- **Script Rule Accuracy** - Stops flagging top-level constants as unused and consistently detects magic numbers in simple return statements.
- **Manifest Naming Expectations** - AMD/SMD naming enforcement skips platform-generated files and tabbed PMD sections evaluate correctly.
