## ✨ Overview

Arcane Auditor channels ancient wisdom through **48 validation rules** to reveal subtle code quality issues invisible to compilers but obvious to master developers.

It analyzes:

- **📄 PMD** — Page definitions with embedded scripts and endpoints
- **🧩 Pod** — Reusable widget components
- **📜 Script** — Function libraries and utilities
- **🔄 Orchestration** — All templates + suborchestrations
- **🗝️ AMD / 🔒 SMD** — Application and security manifests

**Key Traits**

- 🧙 Always-ready reviewer that understands Extend best practices
- 🔍 Precise line-level detection
- 🧠 Context-aware validation (cross-file and cross-field)
- ⚙️ Update-safe configuration layering
- 📊 Multiple output formats: Excel (desktop UI and CLI), JSON (CLI only)

**New in v2.0:**

- 🤖 **Agent-friendly CLI** — a single `--agent` flag turns the CLI into a clean tool-call surface for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.). v2 JSON schema with stable `finding_id`, JSONPath locations, `suggested_replacement` text on several (but not all!) rules, and a bundled `SKILL.md` so agents know how to drive it. The desktop app is still the recommended experience for humans — agent mode is purely additive for teams that already work alongside an agent.
- 🛡️ **No auto-fix, no hosted LLM, no code leaves your machine.** The tool surfaces findings and (where deterministic) a suggested replacement string — your agent or you decide whether to splice it in.

## **Earlier highlights (v1.6):**

- **Desktop: analyze a project folder** — pick a directory on disk for recursive analysis (same model as the CLI), with a Browse menu for ZIP, files, or folder.

## 🚀 Quick Start — Desktop App

## ⚔️ Command Line Interface

For automation, CI/CD pipelines, and power users who prefer the terminal:

**Download:**

- **Windows:** `ArcaneAuditorCLI.exe`
- **macOS:** `ArcaneAuditor_macOS_CLI.zip` (unzip to get `ArcaneAuditorCLI`)
- **Linux (CLI only):** `ArcaneAuditor_linux_CLI.tar.gz` and matching `ArcaneAuditor_linux_CLI.tar.gz.sha256`

**Usage:**

```bash
# Analyze an app
ArcaneAuditorCLI review-app myapp.zip

# Use specific configuration
ArcaneAuditorCLI review-app myapp.zip --config production-ready

# Export results to Excel
ArcaneAuditorCLI review-app myapp.zip --format excel --output report.xlsx

# CI/CD: one flag for quiet, JSON, and default output file (arcane-auditor-results.json)
ArcaneAuditorCLI review-app myapp.zip --ci

# Or specify format/output explicitly
ArcaneAuditorCLI review-app myapp.zip --format json --output report.json
```

**For CI/CD pipelines:** use `--ci` to enable a preset that is quiet (no status chatter), outputs JSON, and writes to a default file (`arcane-auditor-results.json`) unless you pass `--output`. You can still override with `--format` or `--output` when needed.

**Using the Linux CLI:**

1. Download the `.tar.gz` from [Releases](https://github.com/Developers-and-Dragons/ArcaneAuditor/releases).
2. Verify the archive: `sha256sum -c ArcaneAuditor_linux_CLI.tar.gz.sha256`
3. Extract: `tar xzf ArcaneAuditor_linux_CLI.tar.gz`
4. Run: `./ArcaneAuditorCLI review-app myapp.zip` (or add to PATH).

**Docker (definition files only):** The repo includes Dockerfiles for running the CLI from source (`Dockerfile.cli-src`) or from the built Linux binary (`Dockerfile.cli-binary`). These are definition files only — no prebuilt images are published. Build and run locally or in your CI; use a `/work` (or similar) mount for the app under analysis. See [docker/README.md](docker/README.md) for build and run examples.

**Exit Codes for CI/CD:**


| Exit Code | Meaning          | Use Case              |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| **0**     | ✅ Clean          | No ACTION issues      |
| **1**     | ⚠️ Issues Found  | ACTION issues present |
| **2**     | ❌ Usage Error    | Invalid files/config  |
| **3**     | 💥 Runtime Error | Analysis failure      |

## 🤖 Agent Mode

The same CLI binary doubles as a clean tool-call surface for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and friends). Run with `--agent` and the auditor behaves like a well-mannered tool: quiet, JSON-on-stdout, schema-stable.

> 🛡️ **What this is — and isn't.**
> Arcane Auditor does **not** auto-apply fixes, and **no LLM is bundled or called**. Your code never leaves the machine. Agent mode just makes findings legible to the agent *you already use*, so it can decide what to do with them.

**Quick try:**

```bash
ArcaneAuditorCLI review-app myapp.zip --agent
```

**What `--agent` gives you over `--ci`:**

- 📐 **v2 JSON schema** — `schema_version: "2.0"`, nested `location`, and rule metadata (`category`, `fix_strategy`) on every finding.
- 🪪 **Stable `finding_id`** — hash of rule + file + path + message (line excluded), so re-runs after a fix still join on the same identifier.
- 🧭 **JSONPath `location.path`** — for PMD / POD / AMD / SMD findings, a JSONPath that survives line-drifting edits (e.g. `$.outboundEndpoints[?(@.name=='getWorker')].failOnStatusCodes`). Script-file findings use line/column.
- ✏️ **suggested_replacement** — drop-in replacement text on many deterministic rules (e.g. `var`→`let`, hardcoded Workday API → `apiGatewayEndpoint + '<path>'`). All other rules carry `fix_strategy: human_review` — the agent is told plainly when it should *not* assume a one-line patch.
- 🔍 **Filter flags** — `--rules`, `--exclude-rules`, `--severity`, `--fix-strategy`, `--files <glob,glob>` so the agent can scope a focused pass without re-running the world.
- 📚 **Rule introspection** — `list-rules --format json` for the catalog, `describe-rule <RuleId>` for full metadata (the `why` / `catches` / `examples` / `recommendation` an agent needs to reason about a finding).

**Setting up the CLI for agent use:**

1. **Make the binary reachable.** Pick one:
  - **PATH (recommended).** Windows: add the directory containing `ArcaneAuditorCLI.exe` to PATH. macOS: unzip `ArcaneAuditor_macOS_CLI.zip` to a stable location (e.g. `~/tools/ArcaneAuditorCLI/`) and symlink the inner `ArcaneAuditorCLI` into `/usr/local/bin`. The macOS build is a onedir bundle — *move the whole folder together*, don't extract just the executable.
  - **Absolute path.** Save the binary anywhere stable and tell the agent the full path once at the start of the session.
2. **Install the skill file.** The CLI ships with a bundled `SKILL.md` (commands, schema, loop strategy). Emit it into your agent's skill directory:
  ```bash
   # Example: Claude Code
   ArcaneAuditorCLI agent-help > ~/.claude/skills/arcane-auditor/SKILL.md
  ```
   The same file works for any agent that follows the cross-vendor `SKILL.md` convention (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.).

## ⚙️ Configuration

Arcane Auditor uses a **layered, update-safe configuration** system:

1. **Built-in Presets**
  - `development` — lenient, allows console logs / work-in-progress code
  - `production-ready` — strict, deployment-grade validation
2. **Team Configuration**
  - Windows: `%AppData%\ArcaneAuditor\config\rules\teams\`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ArcaneAuditor/config/rules/teams/`
  - Linux (CLI): `~/.config/ArcaneAuditor/config/rules/teams/`
3. **Personal Configuration**
  - Windows: `%AppData%\ArcaneAuditor\config\rules\personal\`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/ArcaneAuditor/config/rules/personal/`
  - Linux (CLI): `~/.config/ArcaneAuditor/config/rules/personal/`
4. **Command-line overrides** (highest priority)

**Example personal config:**

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "ScriptConsoleLogRule": { "enabled": false },
    "ScriptLongBlockRule": {
      "custom_settings": { "max_lines": 50, "skip_comments": true }
    }
  }
}
```

Use via CLI:

```bash
ArcaneAuditorCLI review-app myapp.zip --config my-config
```

## 🧠 Validation Rules

Arcane Auditor enforces **48 rules** across two realms:

### 📜 Script Quality (22)

Complexity limits • long-function checks • unused variables/functions • naming • magic numbers • descriptive parameters

### 🗝️ Structural Integrity (26)

Widget IDs • endpoint failOnStatusCodes • naming conventions • file structure • security domain checks • orchestration (error handlers, security domains, branching, expression best practices)

> 📖 See full details: [Rule Documentation](docs/RULES.md)

---

## ⚡ Advanced Usage

🧩 Context Awareness

Arcane Auditor detects missing files and adjusts validation scope automatically:

- **Complete** when PMD + AMD + SMD provided
- **Partial** when some missing (rules skipped with clear indicators)
- Reports list skipped or partial rules and suggest required files.

🔧 Port Configuration (Desktop App)

The desktop app runs a local server (default port 8080).
If you have a port conflict, edit:

**Windows:** `%AppData%\ArcaneAuditor\config\web\web_service_config.json`
**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/ArcaneAuditor/config/web/web_service_config.json`

```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8081,
  "log_level": "info"
}
```
